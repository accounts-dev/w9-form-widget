# Paste your n8n Webhook URL here.
# In n8n, create a Webhook trigger node (POST method) and copy the URL.

# A single URL works for all events (form.opened, form.started, form.progress, form.completed).
# Route events inside n8n using a Switch/IF node on {{ $json.event }}
#
# Example: https://your-n8n.example.com/webhook/abc123-def456
